# Statistical Plots & Distribution Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the distribution of restaurant bills using the Seaborn "tips" dataset. Statistical visualization techniques were applied to understand data distribution, detect outliers, and compare groups.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Analysis Performed
- Histogram with KDE to inspect distribution shape
- Boxplot to detect outliers and analyze spread
- Group comparison of total bills across different days

## Outputs
The following plots were generated and saved:
- histogram_total_bill.png
- boxplot_total_bill.png
- comparison_by_day.png

## Conclusion
The analysis shows variation in total bill amounts across different days and highlights the importance of visualization in understanding distribution, spread, and potential outliers before applying statistical models.
